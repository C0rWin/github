During day-to-day, developers facing with deadlines, different project commitments, bug fixing, maitenance and support. There is always not enough time for code improvements and refactoring. I wish I'll have some free day I could easily practice and improve my development skills without having all this duties on head. 

So here it comes again:

>On 14th of December there will be [Global Day of Code Retreat][gdcr] event, which this year is hosted by [Ebay Israel Innovation Center][ebayil]. You can find more on [about] page and take a look on following video:
